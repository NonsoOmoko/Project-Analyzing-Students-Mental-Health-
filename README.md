# Project-Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health-

Welcome to the Student Mental Health Analysis project repository! This project aims to explore the factors influencing mental well-being among students using survey data from a Japanese international university. By analyzing various aspects such as length of stay, language proficiency, and academic level, we seek to understand the prevalence of depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress among students.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains responses to a survey conducted at the Japanese international university. It includes information on students' demographic characteristics, academic status, mental health indicators, and other relevant factors.

## Analysis

We utilize PostgreSQL for data analysis, employing SQL queries to extract insights from the dataset. The analysis focuses on examining the relationships between different variables and mental health outcomes, identifying trends, and uncovering potential areas for intervention.

## Repository Structure

- `students.csv`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Notebook containing SQL queries for data analysis.
- `README.md`: You are here! Provides an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already.
3. Import the dataset into your PostgreSQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries in `notebook.ipynb` to perform the analysis.
